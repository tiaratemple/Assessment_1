// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning

//1. planning
//2.analysis of requirements
//3.design
//4.implementation
//5.testing and integration
//6.maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, in which a team would define the resources needed to build a project. A team might require a search feature."

const design = "This is the third step, which models the way a software application will work. Some aspects of the design may include: architecture, user interface, security, etc."

const implementation = "This is the fourth step, which is the actual writing of the program. A small project be written by one person, while a large project may have teams."

const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step, which insures everything is working properly. This phase helps reduce the number of bugs for the user."

const maintain = "This is the last step, which means the application is done and being used in the field. Bugs will be discovered and errors will need to be fixed."
